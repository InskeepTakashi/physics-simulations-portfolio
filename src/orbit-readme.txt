Description:
    A physics-based simulation demonstrating Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion. 
    Features real-time orbital calculations with smooth animations showing how orbital 
    period relates to distance from the central star. Built with React and optimized 
    for 60fps performance using requestAnimationFrame.

Key Features:
    * Real-time implementation of Kepler's Third Law
    * Smooth 60fps animation using requestAnimationFrame
    * Interactive orbital period control (1-100 seconds)
    * Live calculation display (period, time, radius, angular velocity)
    * Dynamic orbit visualization that scales with distance
    * Play/pause and reset controls
    * Responsive dark theme UI

Technical Skills:
    * Advanced React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback)
    * Physics simulation and mathematical modeling
    * Performance optimization with requestAnimationFrame
    * Real-time data visualization
    * Component composition and props handling
    * Responsive CSS Grid layouts

Technical Implementation:
    * useRef for animation frame management and timing
    * useCallback for optimized animation loops
    * Mathematical calculations for orbital mechanics
    * Dynamic CSS transforms for planet positioning
    * Event-driven state management for user controls
    * Component-based architecture for reusable elements

Learning Outcomes:
    * Implementing complex physics simulations in JavaScript
    * Managing high-performance animations in React
    * Creating educational visualizations for scientific concepts
    * Optimizing render performance for smooth user experience
    * Building intuitive interfaces for interactive simulations
