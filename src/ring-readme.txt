Planetary Ring System Visualizer
    Developed by Takashi Inskeep
    With Claude AI troubleshooting assistance

Description:

    An interactive astronomical simulation demonstrating how planetary rings appear from
    different orbital perspectives. Built with React, featuring real-time mathematical
    calculations and smooth animations. This simulator models how planetary rings would
    appear to an observer on a moon orbiting at various inclinations, helping visualize
    complex 3D orbital mechanics in an intuitive way.

Key Features:
    * Real-time orbital mechanics simulation
    * Interactive parameter controls
    * Smooth 60fps animation system
    * Responsive touch/mouse interactions
    * Mathematical accuracy in astronomical relationships

Technical Skills:
    * React hooks and state management
    * Mathematical programming (trigonometry)
    * CSS animations and transformations
    * Performance optimization
    * User interaction handling

Technical Implementation
    * useState for real-time state management
    * useEffect for animation loops and cleanup
    * CSS transforms for 3D visual effects
    * Event handling for interactive controls

Learning Outcomes:
    * Implementing complex mathematical models in JavaScript
    * Managing smooth animations with React hooks
    * Optimizing performance for real-time updates
    * Creating intuitive user interfaces for scientific data
