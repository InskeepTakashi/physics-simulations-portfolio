**Key Features:**
- Real-time orbital mechanics calculations using trigonometry
- Interactive parameter controls with smooth animations
- 60fps performance optimization
- Mobile-responsive touch controls
- Mathematically accurate astronomical relationships

### üåç Orbital Mechanics Simulation

**Key Features:**
- Implementation of Kepler's Third Law (T¬≤ ‚àù a¬≥)
- Smooth animations using requestAnimationFrame
- Real-time calculation display (period, radius, angular velocity)
- Interactive orbital period adjustment
- Dynamic orbit visualization that scales with distance

### ‚öΩ Physics Ball Bounce Simulation
A multi-object physics engine featuring bouncing balls with realistic gravity and collision detection. Each ball maintains independent physics while sharing global parameters.
